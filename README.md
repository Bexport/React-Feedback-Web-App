# React Feedback Web App Project

This project is a simple web app that allows users to add, delete, and edit feedback cards which are managed with a mock REST api with a json-server.

## Scripts for testing

Make sure to run these two installations if not already installed:

### `npm i json-server`
### `npm i concurrently`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
